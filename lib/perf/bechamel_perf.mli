(** This module provides several event counters from the [perf] API provided by
    Linux (2.6+) - and they are {b not} compatible with other systems. These
    counters are basically what the [perf] command provides.

    For some events, it is necessary {b to be root}. If you try to use these
    counters with insufficient privileges, [Bechamel_perf] will report you an
    permission error.

    If you want to use [Bechamel_perf] as a normal user, you should take a look
    on {{:https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt}the
    documentation about [perf_paranoid]}.

    If the user wants to measuring the kernel, the program must be run as root.
    We cannot measure in a virtualized environment ([ENOENT] is returned). *)
